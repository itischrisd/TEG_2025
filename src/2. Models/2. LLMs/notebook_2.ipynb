      "The sky appears blue primarily due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight Composition**: Sunlight (or white light) is made up of many colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength, while red light has a longer wavelength.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Earth’s Atmosphere**: As sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with air molecules and tiny particles. The shorter wavelengths (blue and violet light) are scattered in all directions much more than the longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Human Perception**: Although both blue and violet light are scattered, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and less sensitive to violet light. Additionally, some of the violet light is absorbed by the ozone layer in the atmosphere. As a result, we perceive the sky as blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "During sunrise and sunset, the sun's light must pass through a larger portion of the atmosphere, causing more scattering of the shorter wavelengths and allowing the longer wavelengths (reds and oranges) to dominate, which is why the sky can appear red or orange at those times.\n"
