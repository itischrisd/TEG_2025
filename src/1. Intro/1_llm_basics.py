🚀 Large Language Models (LLMs) - Interactive Educational Journey
===============================================================

Welcome to your hands-on exploration of Large Language Models! This script takes you
through the fundamental concepts that make LLMs work, using practical examples that
you can run, modify, and experiment with.

🎯 What You'll Learn:
- How system prompts shape AI behavior
- The impact of temperature on creativity and consistency
- How token limits control response length and cost
- Advanced parameter combinations for different use cases
- Real-world applications and best practices

🔧 Prerequisites:
- OpenAI API key in .env file (OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here)
- Python 3.10+ with openai and python-dotenv packages

System prompts are special instructions that define how an AI should behave.
Think of them as giving the AI a "role" or "character" to play.

Key principles:
• Be specific about tone, style, and expertise level
• Define the AI's role clearly (teacher, expert, assistant)
• Set expectations for response format and length
• Consider your audience (beginners vs experts)

CONCEPT: Temperature Parameter
Temperature controls how "creative" or "random" the AI's responses are.

Temperature Scale:
• 0.0-0.3: Very focused, deterministic, repeatable
• 0.5-1.0: Balanced creativity and coherence
• 1.0-2.0: Highly creative, diverse, potentially unexpected

Use cases:
• Low (0.1): Factual answers, coding, math problems
• Medium (1.0): Creative writing, brainstorming, conversations
• High (1.8): Art, poetry, very creative tasks

"""
Tokens are the building blocks of LLM processing (roughly 3/4 of a word).
The max_tokens parameter limits how long responses can be.

Token Economics:
• You pay for both input AND output tokens
• Longer responses cost more money
• Token limits force the AI to be concise
• Average: 1 token ≈ 0.75 words in English

Strategic uses:
• Short limits: Force concise answers, save costs
• Medium limits: Balanced detail and cost
• Long limits: Detailed explanations, comprehensive responses

🧠 WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED:

1. 🎭 SYSTEM PROMPTS are your most powerful tool
   • Define AI personality, expertise, and communication style
   • Critical for setting user expectations and response quality
   • Always be specific about role, tone, and output format

2. 🌡️ TEMPERATURE controls creativity vs consistency
   • 0.0-0.3: Factual, repeatable, focused (great for technical tasks)
   • 0.5-1.0: Balanced creativity and coherence (conversations, content)
   • 1.0-2.0: Highly creative and diverse (art, brainstorming, fiction)

3. 🔢 TOKENS manage cost, length, and focus
   • You pay for input AND output tokens
   • Lower limits force conciseness and save money
   • Higher limits allow detailed explanations

4. 🎯 TOP_P refines word choice diversity
   • Works with temperature to fine-tune creativity
   • Lower values = more focused vocabulary choices
   • Professional tip: Adjust both temperature AND top_p together

5. 🔧 PARAMETER COMBINATIONS solve real problems
   • Each use case needs its own optimal configuration
   • Start with proven professional configurations
   • Always test and iterate based on your specific needs

🚀 NEXT STEPS FOR MASTERY:

🔬 EXPERIMENT:
• Try building your own customer service bot
