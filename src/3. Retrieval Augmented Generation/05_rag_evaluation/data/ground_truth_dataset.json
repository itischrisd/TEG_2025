    "question": "What is Einstein's theory of relativity about?",
    "ground_truth": "Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity is a two-part framework\u2014special (1905) and general (1915)\u2014that explains the structure of space and time, how motion works at high speeds, and what gravity really is.\n\nSpecial Relativity (SR): motion near the speed of light\n- Core postulates:\n  - The laws of physics are the same in all inertial (non-accelerating) frames.\n  - The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion or the source\u2019s motion.\n- Key consequences:\n  - Relativity of simultaneity: events that are simultaneous in one frame need not be in another.\n  - Time dilation: moving clocks tick more slowly compared with stationary ones.\n  - Length contraction: objects are measured shorter along the direction of motion.\n  - New velocity-addition rule that prevents any signal from exceeding light speed.\n  - Mass\u2013energy equivalence (E = mc\u00b2): mass is a form of energy.\n  - Unified spacetime picture (Minkowski spacetime) replaces separate absolute space and time.\n- Evidence and use: confirmed in particle accelerators, precision timing experiments with fast-moving clocks, and is essential to technologies like GPS (together with GR).\n\nGeneral Relativity (GR): gravity as spacetime curvature\n- Core idea:\n  - Equivalence principle: locally, effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable.\n  - Gravity is not a force in the Newtonian sense; mass\u2013energy curves spacetime, and objects (and light) follow the straightest possible paths (geodesics) in that curved geometry.\n- Key predictions and phenomena:\n  - Gravitational time dilation: clocks run slower deeper in gravitational fields.\n  - Gravitational redshift: light loses energy (shifts to longer wavelengths) climbing out of gravity.\n  - Bending of light by gravity (gravitational lensing).\n  - Anomalous precession of planetary orbits (e.g., Mercury).\n  - Shapiro time delay (signals take longer near massive bodies).\n  - Gravitational waves: ripples in spacetime from accelerating masses (directly detected in 2015).\n  - Black holes and cosmological expansion models.\n- Evidence and use: starlight deflection observed during eclipses, precision spacecraft tracking, pulsar timing, gravitational-wave detections, and necessary corrections for satellite navigation (GPS).\n\nCommon misconception\n- \u201cRelativity\u201d does not mean everything is relative. Certain quantities are invariant: the speed of light in vacuum, the spacetime interval, and the form of physical laws.\n\nIn short, relativity is about how space, time, motion, energy, and gravity are interwoven. Special relativity governs high-speed motion and unites space and time; general relativity explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass\u2013energy. These ideas underpin modern physics and have been repeatedly confirmed experimentally."

    "question": "What are Newton's three laws of motion?",
    "ground_truth": "Newton\u2019s three laws of motion (valid in inertial reference frames) are:\n\n1) First Law (Law of Inertia)\n- Statement: A body remains at rest, or moves in a straight line at constant speed, unless acted upon by a net external force.\n- Meaning: Zero net force implies zero acceleration. This law defines inertial frames and introduces inertia (resistance to changes in motion).\n- Example: A passenger lurches forward when a car stops suddenly because their body tends to maintain its prior state of motion.\n\n2) Second Law (Law of Dynamics)\n- Statement: The net external force on a body equals the time rate of change of its momentum: F_net = dp/dt.\n- Constant-mass form: If mass m is constant, this reduces to F_net = m\u00b7a (acceleration is in the direction of the net force).\n- Impulse form: The integral of force over time equals the change in momentum: \u222bF dt = \u0394p.\n- Consequences: Larger forces produce larger accelerations; for a given force, more massive objects accelerate less. Units: 1 newton (N) = 1 kg\u00b7m/s\u00b2.\n- Example: Pushing a shopping cart\u2014doubling the push (force) doubles its acceleration; loading it with more mass reduces its acceleration for the same push.\n\n3) Third Law (Action\u2013Reaction)\n- Statement: For every force that body A exerts on body B, body B exerts an equal and opposite force on body A: F_AB = \u2212F_BA. These forces are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and act on different bodies.\n- System view: Internal action\u2013reaction force pairs cancel in the net force on a closed system, underpinning conservation of momentum (with any field momentum included when needed).\n- Examples: Recoil of a gun, a rocket expelling exhaust, or a person pushing the ground while walking.\n\nNotes and scope:\n- These laws describe motion accurately at everyday speeds and sizes in inertial frames. In non-inertial frames, fictitious forces (e.g., centrifugal) must be introduced; at very high speeds or strong gravity, relativistic and general relativistic corrections are needed; in some electromagnetic situations, momentum in the fields must be included for exact action\u2013reaction accounting."

    "question": "What did Charles Darwin discover?",
    "ground_truth": "- Core discovery: Darwin discovered the mechanism of evolution by natural selection. He showed that:\n  - Individuals vary in heritable traits.\n  - More offspring are produced than can survive, creating a struggle for existence.\n  - Individuals with traits better suited to their environment survive and reproduce more, so advantageous traits become more common over generations.\n  - Over long timescales this \u201cdescent with modification\u201d produces adaptation and the branching tree of life (common descent).\n\n- Evidence and scope: Drawing on observations from the HMS Beagle voyage\u2014biogeography (e.g., Gal\u00e1pagos finches and tortoises), comparative anatomy, and the fossil record\u2014he assembled compelling evidence that all species share common ancestors and diversify through natural selection (adaptive radiation).\n\n- Additional evolutionary insight: He also identified sexual selection as a distinct evolutionary process explaining traits that confer mating advantage rather than direct survival benefit.\n\n- Related scientific contributions: Beyond biology, Darwin explained major geological and biological patterns, including a theory of coral reef and atoll formation linked to the subsidence of volcanic islands, and later conducted influential botanical studies (e.g., on climbing plants and insectivorous plants) that reinforced how selection shapes form and function.\n\nIn short, Darwin didn\u2019t merely assert that species change; he discovered and demonstrated how they change\u2014the process of evolution by natural selection\u2014and provided broad, multidisciplinary evidence for common descent."

    "question": "What was Ada Lovelace's contribution to computing?",
    "ground_truth": "Ada Lovelace\u2019s key contribution was to articulate, in detail, how a general-purpose computing machine could be instructed to perform complex tasks\u2014and to demonstrate this with the first published algorithm intended for execution by a machine.\n\n- Working with Charles Babbage\u2019s design for the Analytical Engine, she translated Luigi Menabrea\u2019s 1842 paper and added extensive Notes (far longer than the original). These Notes explained how to encode step-by-step, machine-readable instructions and data for the Engine.\n- In Note G, she published a procedure for the Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers\u2014the first algorithm specifically designed for a machine to execute\u2014so she is often regarded as the world\u2019s first computer programmer.\n- She went beyond arithmetic, explaining that such a machine could manipulate symbols as well as numbers and foreseeing applications like generating music and producing graphics\u2014an early, clear statement of the idea of general-purpose computing.\n- Her analysis and exposition publicized and clarified Babbage\u2019s work, effectively laying out early principles of programming (sequencing operations, encoding instructions and variables on cards) and the broader scope of what computing machines could do."
